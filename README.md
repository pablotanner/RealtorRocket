# Realtor Rocket: Real Estate Management Software
- Realtor Rocket is a real estate management application built using Vite+React (frontend), Express.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL (backend). 
- It is designed to help real estate agents and property managers manage their properties, tenants, leases, payments, maintenance, and more. 
- It was started as a project for my personal portfolio but has not been fully completed yet, and I am no longer working on it. 
- Setup guide is provided further below if you would like to run it locally.
